Dropbox announced a series of new hires for its company leadership team on
Wednesday. Among them is former Hewlett-Packard director Condoleezza Rice, who
was appointed as Chief World Domination Officer.

Dropbox President Drew Houston announced that Dr Rice would help the company
with "expanding their global footprint," and help "navigate [privacy
concerns]" â€” all said with a sinister smirk.

American rock band _Pearl Jam_ has also been revealed to be an investor in the
company. The band's lead singer Eddie Vedder and Dr Rice are now no longer
allowed to be in the same room as each other.

Competitor Box.com's CEO Aaron Levie was not fazed by the news, stating that the
company was in talks to bring on-board former Vice President and inventor of the
Internet, Al Gore.

Dropbox is slated to file for secession from the United States sometime in late
2014 to early 2015, in an effort to hire more foreign engineers by bypassing US
immigration laws, and to also acquire a .dropbox gTLD without having to file
with ICANN.
