Creator of high-profile online trading card trading post MtGox Mark Karpeles has
announced the recovery of 200,000 trading cards from underneath his zabuton.

Earlier this month, MtGox announced the loss of 850,000 _Magic: The Gathering_
cards to due "cardboard malleability", an unforeseen technical issue where
cards could lose their value after permanent creasing. This issue has apparently
led to a subsequent shutdown of the exchange and its filing for bankruptcy.

The shutdown had dealt a heavy blow to the _Magic: The Gathering_ industry, with
investors now uncertain of the alternative trading card's fate. Proponents of
believe that the trading card will withstand what is hoped to be a momentary
setback, but other investors are looking to eventually recover their assets as
_Yu-Gi-Oh!_ cards.

"We feel that MtGox's actions have betrayed the community as a whole," says a
spokesperson from competing exchange, ManaDesk. "This has really undermined the
trust people were gaining in a viable alternative to fiat cards; in
democratizing a domain previously dominated by casino-controlled playing cards."

Among the recovered assets were fragments of the card "Chaos Confetti."
