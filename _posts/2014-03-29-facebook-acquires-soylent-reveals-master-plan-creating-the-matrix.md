Food substitute company Soylent has been acquired by social media giant and
narcissism enabler Facebook, days after the titan's acquisition of virtual
reality headset Oculus Rift.

Facebook is looking at integrating force-feeding tubes into the Oculus headset,
as well as electrodes to harness human bioelectrical energy and read thoughts.
In a press conference, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced: "With this new
partnership between Oculus Rift and Soylent, we are one step closer to world
domination. We will be able to create a world where people will never be able to
leave their news feedsâ€”a fully immersive social experience.

"Now we will be able to deliver more meaningful information in interactions with
Facebook messages. For instance, we'll now be able to differentiate between
whether a message was seen and not replied to because they hate you, or if
they were just lazy."

Privacy experts on Reddit slammed the move, calling it "Orwellian, dystopian and
other words I read in a sci-fi book once."

Oculus Rift CTO and Armadillo Aerospace founder John Carmack deflected the
criticism, responding, "Go away. I'm playing _Kerbal Space Program_."

Soylent has announced no changes in trajectory after the acquisition. Trials for
vegan alternative "Soylent Green" begin in September.
