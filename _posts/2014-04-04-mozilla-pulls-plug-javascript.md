After JavaScript's almost twenty-year-long tenure as the web's one and only
programming language for browsers, its creator, Mozilla, has decided to cease
all support and development on the language. This reaction comes in the wake of
developers who called for a boycott of Mozilla products after finally realizing
that JavaScript is, in fact, pants-on-head stupid.

A formal statement was issued on Thursday by the chairperson of the Mozilla
board:

_Mozilla believes in equality, and JavaScript is not a language that reflects
our values. Seriously, there's like two different equality operators and nobody
knows how one of them works._

JavaScript-powered dating website OkCupid had led the boycott. In response to
today's news, they issued an official statement on Twitter: "Today's decision
reaffirms Mozilla's commitment to the cause," says a spokesperson. The company
is now satisfied that Mozilla will be "taking a number of further steps" with
the destruction of JavaScript, such as replacing it with family-oriented
programming languages like Scratch or Google Blockly.

Reactions to JavaScript's end-of-life status from the wider programming
community were varied, with some now defending JavaScript's existence:
"JavaScript might be broken, but it does its job and I'm okay with that. I mean,
at least it's not PHP."

The developer community had initially condemned Mozilla's support for
JavaScript. "Ruby is Turing-complete, JavaScript is Turing-complete. Just
because Ruby doesn't have first-class functions doesn't mean it's any less of a
programming language," tweeted one developer.

PHP creator Rasmus Lerdorf could not be reached for comment.
