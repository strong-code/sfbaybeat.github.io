Microsoft has announced that it will be open sourcing its .NET compiler platform
at the Build 2014 conference on Thursday. This follows from Microsoft's previous
open source initiatives which released the code to other widely-used products
such as ASP.NET MVC, MS-DOS 1.0 and Word for Windows 1a.

Followers of open source leader and man who cannot find his beard razor Richard
Stallman were not entirely satisfied with the news, citing vague concerns of
the lack of freedoms and still opting to call Microsoft "Micro$oft".

Microsoft's move did not go unnoticed by competitor Oracle, with their CEO
Larry Ellison comparing the open source movement to communism and a "cancer"
that "attaches itself ... to everything it touches". In response, Oracle has
announced that it now be solely distributing the Java 8 compiler on a set of
3.5-inch floppies, accompanied with a hard-copy instruction manual and
holographic license key sticker.

Oracle also continues an ongoing lawsuit against OpenJDK for infringement of its
copyright on the entirety of the Java API.
