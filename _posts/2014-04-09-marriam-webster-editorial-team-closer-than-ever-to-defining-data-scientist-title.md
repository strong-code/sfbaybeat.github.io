The editorial team of Merriam-Webster announced today that they believe a concrete
definition for the term 'Data Scientist' is now closer than ever. With the recent
rise in popularity and usage of the term - particularly in Silicon Valley - 
Merriam-Webster announced it would begin research on figuring out what a data
scientist actually does. 

While research and analysis of the term has been an arduous process for the editorial
team now spanning almost 7 years, they have stated that they are, "[...] determined to
find out exactly what this job title means". Lexical researchers at Merriam-Webster
seemed enthusiastic when asked about the possibility of this big discovery hovering
just on the horizon for them. One researcher expresses his excitement saying, 
"Am I ready for this to be done? Of course I am! Literally no one knows what this
job title even implies but everyone is throwing it around and trying to hire these
so-called 'data scientists'. I hate you, Silicon Valley recruiters."

The team has also stated that in the true nature of Silicon Valley, they are open
to the idea of crowdsourcing a definition for the word and are currently accepting
submissions from the tech community. One such submitter was Harold Chase, a high school
math teacher from Raleigh, NC. When asked about about his submission, Chase stated,
"I mean... I'm just someone who taught basic statistics to high schoolers. But I guess
in the Valley that makes you a data scientist. I don't even know how to write code".

Chase's employer, Cloudera, declined to comment for this article.
