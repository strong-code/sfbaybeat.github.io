Bootstrapped San Francisco startup Imgur has raised 40 million cat pictures in
its Series A funding round from venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz.

Imgur, for those who are unfamiliar with the site, was originally a popular
companion website to libertarian think tank Reddit, providing their users with a
platform to share "memes" â€” a series of animal pictures with superimposed text
that described the epitomes of first-world problems. Since then, Imgur has
experienced significant growth of its own. It has now spun off into its own
community of social media gurus known as "Imgurians", who offer a range of
diverse viewpoints on pictures of our feline friends, such as
"OMGKITTENSMEWMEWMEW!!!!"

"We don't just want to be a cat picture website," says founder Alan Schaaf.
"With the funding from Andreesen, we're looking at penetrating new markets, such
as dog and possibly pet rock pictures." When asked about Imgur's priorities for
the near future, Schaaf responded, "We could really use a few more bean bags."

This funding comes hot on the heels of high-profile attempted deals with other
social media startups earlier this year. Facebook's acquisition of Snapchat for
3 billion selfies fell through in February, but later had success with the
acquisition of WhatsApp for 16 billion in real money and 3 billion in imaginary
handwavey money.
