With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) slated to announce the release of iOS 8 at WWDC14 in
July, a pre-K student from Cupertino has already discovered a backdoor into
the operating system, allowing for iPhone owners to "jailbreak" the device and
enabling them to run _Android Play Store_-quality apps.

The exploit was discovered when the girl's father did not let her buy _Candy
Crush Saga_ from the App Store, prompting her to find ways around bedtime
curfew. The attack? Simple. She manipulated the operating system's SSL protocol
routines by adding the extra command `goto pwn3d` into the coding, causing the
operating system to grant her "root" access.

After the successful iPhone jailbreak, the 3-year-old attempted to exploit her
father's iPad. She is scheduled to appear in court on Monday, charged with one
count of tablet jailbreaking.
